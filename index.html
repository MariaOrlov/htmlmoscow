                 <i>Moscow truly is a mega-metropolis like no other. Its non-stop energy. 
				 <div>You must have asked yourself at some time, “Is it worth traveling to Moscow with children? Of course it is!</div> 
		 My name is Maria Orlov. Before I moved to Israel for 1 year I lived in Moscow and fall in love with this city. In Israel I worked as a tour-operator and created tours to Russia. All these tours were for retieries, but I do beleive that you will find what to do  with children of different ages while your family trip. 
		 
		 <div>You can take different excursions on any language, including hebrew, to the Kremlin, Red Square or St. Basil’s Cathedral, walks through Moscow’s public parks, or a boat cruise, which will be fascinating to both children and adults.
		 On this website you will find places that your children will love. I classified them by themes: zoos, museums, circuses, theaters, etc. Of course it will be impossible for you to visit them all, so choose those that best suit your children’s tastes.</div>
